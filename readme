assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file

    strp.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.
None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
This assessment was fun and I enjoyed working on it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?
None


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."
stra.c: line 162: low priority: 
This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

This deeply nested syntax is neccessary for stra.c to function
    correctly (specifically the Str_search part). Because it is a nested loop,
    we need to go this level of depth in order to properly
    implement my algorithm.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."
strp.c: line 172: low priority:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your

write "None."
None



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."
None

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

It is not possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specificied by the called is large 
enough. We dont know how much was allocated to the character array
because the memory after the null byte could either be part of the 
character array or refer to other pieces of memory allocated
by the program that we dont have the knowledge for as to whether 
it is an offset of the destination string.
